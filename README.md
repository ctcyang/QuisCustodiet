#### QuisCustodiet

The idea is basically to copy the work of PageRank and
Eigenfactor, but for GitHub users by looking at who watches
each other.

This has already been done by
https://github.com/floydsoft/the-most-influential-developers-on-github.

Do I still want to proceed? Probably not.

Different but similar idea: extract the shout outs from TvTropes and
do the same thing, but for that data. Bonus, we can keep the same name.
